<div class="aurora-box">
  <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 400; color: #f7fafc; line-height: 1.6;">I focus on deep generative modeling as a principled route to machine intelligence surpassing human performance.</p>
</div>

**Research:** My research is centered on <span class="aurora-text-about">Efficient & Robust Visual Intelligence</span>, a research direction aimed at unifying *generation speed*, *rich semantic representations*, and *controllability*. Currently, my goal is to build unified generative models capable of robust **conditional sampling** and producing **high-dimensional**, **high-fidelity**, and **diverse samples** in a **single forward pass**. My recent works focus on knowledge distillation and developing a unique class of models that **uniquely support one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation** from **a single network**.

**Previously:** I spent two years as a research resident in the highly selective AI Residency Program at [VinAI Research](https://github.com/VinAIResearch), a lab recognized in the world's top 20 for AI research based on its research output at top-tier conferences like CVPR and NeurIPS. The program provided intensive, PhD-level training, during which I was responsible for the entire research lifecycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and implementation. This rigorous environment has a proven record of 119 PhD scholarships worldwide. The program's elite status was further underscored by Qualcomm's [acquisition of its generative AI unit in 2025](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/qualcomm-acquires-generative-ai-division-of-vietnamese-startup-vinai/).

**Beyond Research:** I love the combination of mathematics, coding, and intuition. When I'm not debugging models or reading papers, you'll find me running half marathons üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
