**Research:** My research interest lies in developing robust generative models and applying them to diverse applications, including conditional sampling, disentangled representation learning, and reasoning. Currently, my goal is to build a generative model capable of producing high-fidelity, diverse, and high-dimensional samples in a single forward pass. My recent works focus on image generation and manipulation using ODE/SDE-based generative models, specifically diffusion probabilistic models.

**Previously:** I spent two years as a researcher in the highly selective AI Residency Program at [VinAI Research](https://github.com/VinAIResearch), a lab recognized in the world's top 20 for AI research based on its research output at top-tier conferences like CVPR and NeurIPS. The program provided intensive, PhD-level training, during which I was responsible for the entire research lifecycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and implementation. This rigorous environment has a proven record of 119 PhD scholarships worldwide. The program's elite status was further underscored by Qualcomm's [acquisition of its generative AI unit in 2025](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/qualcomm-acquires-generative-ai-division-of-vietnamese-startup-vinai/).

**Beyond Research:** I love the combination of mathematics, coding, and intuition. When I'm not debugging models or reading papers, you'll find me running half marathons üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
