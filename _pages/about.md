  <strong>I focus on deep generative modeling as a principled route to machine intelligence surpassing human performance.</strong>

**Research:** My goal is to build powerful AI models capable of understanding, generating and reasoning with high-dimensional data across diverse modalities. I am currently focused on developing transferable techniques to improve generative models, including architecture, optimization, training objectives, and data efficiency. I invented many foundational concepts and techniques in (score-based) diffusion models, for which you can find more in a [blog post](/blog/2021/score/), a [quanta magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-physics-principle-that-inspired-modern-ai-art-20230105/), or a recent [interview](https://x.com/slaterstich/status/1911817486439461009).

**Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon). I was a research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), Uber ATG, and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml), [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/), and [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php).
