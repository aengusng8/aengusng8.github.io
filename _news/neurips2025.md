⚡ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21250v1">Improved Training Technique for Shortcut Models</a> got accepted at <strong>NeurIPS 2025</strong>. This paper tackle the five core issues that held shortcut models back: the hidden **flaw of compounding guidance**, **inflexible fixed guidance**, **frequency bias**, **divergent self-consistency**, and **curvy flow trajectories**. Our method achieves **state-of-the-art FID scores**, making shortcut models a viable class of generative models capable of **one-step, few-step, and multi-step sampling**.
