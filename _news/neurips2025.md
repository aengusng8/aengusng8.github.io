âš¡ **Improved Training Technique for Shortcut Models (iSM)** got accepted at <strong style="background: linear-gradient(45deg, #f960eb, #ff854d, #fff41f); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; background-clip: text; text-fill-color: transparent; font-weight: bold;">NeurIPS 2025</strong>. This paper tackle the five core issues that held shortcut models back: the hidden flaw of **compounding guidance**, **inflexible fixed guidance**, **frequency bias**, **divergent self-consistency**, and **curvy flow trajectories**. Our method achieves **state-of-the-art FID scores**, making shortcut models a viable class of generative models capable of **one-step, few-step, and multi-step sampling**.
